Left-Leaning Red-Black BSTs

Left Leaning Red-Black BSTs are a type of balance search tree that utilizes left-leaning red links/edges to indicate grouping within a node. Very similar to Red-Black trees and 2-3-4 trees with a difference in formatting and balancing.

We have attached our source code in this repository as leanleft.cpp. For test cases, we included the Shrek movie script, the Gettysburg Address, and the Declaration of Independence.

In order to compile, simply use CS50 IDE and use g++ leanleft.cpp -o "filename", where the "filename" can be whatever you please.

Once it compiles, use ./"filename", followed by textfile.txt, where the "textfile" is whatever you insert. 

We attached test cases small and large for this, however we wish to point out that the source code only compiles and does not run properly, much to our disappointment. We did put a lot of effort into this project, however due to other academic and life challenges we could not get it running before the deadline. 

We hope that you do find our effort through our presentation, report, and what we do have for implementation.
